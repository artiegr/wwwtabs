<h1>Review Of‭ ‬12‭ ‬Budget Scorecards,‭ ‬Indexes or‭  ‬Ranking Systems</h1>
<h3>Arthur Gron<br>
September, 2017.</h3>

<p>The purpose of this is to see what type of scorecard,‭ ‬index,‭ ‬or‭ ‬ranking works well.‭  ‬Budgetpedia's Toronto Annual‭ ‬Budget‭ ‬Scorecard‭  ‬(TABS‭) ‬hopes to‭ ‬evaluate the city of the Toronto's budget by comparing it with cities of a‭ ‬similar size.‭  ‬Other scorecards exist but few are specific to Toronto or to a municipal budget.‭  ‬This‭ ‬paper‭ ‬examines some that exist.‭  ‬They were found using‭ ‬a‭ ‬simple Internet search.‭  ‬The first‭ ‬12‭ ‬that were relevant‭ (‬municipal oriented,‭ ‬reflecting policy items that would impact a budget‭) ‬were selected.‭ ‬ An attempt was made to mix scorecards created by non-profit agencies as well as for profit business and media organizations.‭  ‬This was to get a wide variety of examples.‭</p>

<p>After reading through‭ ‬12‭ ‬existing systems I noted their methodology,‭ ‬evaluated what I felt were positive attributes for each,‭ ‬and record criticisms I think were warranted.‭  ‬Next I tried to see if I could recognize any trends in the methodologies.‭  ‬Below I begin with the overall findings and then follow up with each of the‭ ‬12‭ ‬different scorecards.‭</p>

<h3>Examples of‭ ‬indexes,‭ ‬scorecards‭ ‬or ranking systems‭ ‬that worked well.‭</h3>

<p>The main theme that emerged from‭ ‬examining the‭ ‬12‭ ‬different types of ranking systems is that complexity should be avoided,‭ ‬and that background qualitative information needs to be provided at the expense of volume of data.‭  ‬It would also be beneficial to create original data and not recompile existing information.‭</p>

<p><em>1.‭ ‬A good background‭ ‬explaining‭ ‬what is meant by‭ ‬a metro's‭ ‬political vs.‭ ‬geographical boundary,‭ ‬and‭ ‬basic‭ ‬demographics</em></p>

<p>Toronto's Vital Signs Report and Toronto Region Board of Trade's Scorecard on Prosperity both give good background regarding what is meant by the city boundary that is being studied.‭ ‬The political boundary of a city may be different from the economic boundary.‭  ‬Toronto's border ends at Steels Ave.,‭ ‬but many people consider Markham and Richmond Hill by what is meant by Toronto.‭  ‬When comparing cities‭ ‬it‭ ‬is important to state what is the exact area being compared and why.‭ ‬Also,‭ ‬including the basic demographics of a city helps to visualize other issues that are being discusses,‭ ‬such as total size of the budget.‭</p>

<p><em>2.‭ ‬Use a simple score‭ ‬(so that‭ ‬it can be adapted by others‭ ‬/‭ ‬sum up neatly‭ ‬any meta-data analysis‭)</em></p>

<p>A simple score makes a comparison between several cities easier to digest.‭  ‬Perhaps the best example of this would be the‭ ‬Globalization and World Cities Research Network‭ ‬(GaWC‭)‬,‭ ‬this uses the designation of Alpha,‭ ‬Beta and Gamma to rank cities.‭ ‬These groups are easy to remember.‭  ‬Though GaWC has a complex networking analysis to rank each city the resultant rankings summarize the network analysis impressively.‭ ‬A simple ranking also means that the rankings can be easily used by others.‭  ‬The‭ ‬Mercer's‭ ‬Quality of Living‭  ‬Ranking,‭ ‬The‭ ‬Global Financial Centres‭ ‬Index‭ ‬21,‭ ‬and the‭ ‬World Justice Project‭ ‬all have simple rankings for cities.‭  ‬However by merely ranking cities in order the studies make the mistake of projection too much accuracy for the research tool used.‭ ‬Is there a real difference between a city ranked‭ ‬271‭ ‬and‭ ‬272‭?  ‬GaWC ranked ordered categories is ideal in that its categories are wide enough to include several cities.‭  ‬ Cities like Sydney and Chicago are listed in the same category.‭</p>

<p><em>3.‭ ‬Create some‭ ‬original data‭ ‬(through surveys‭)</em></p>

<p>The Global Financial Centres Index‭ ‬21‭ ‬uses on online questionnaire as part of its methodology as does the World Justice Project,‭ ‬Rule of Law Index.‭ ‬This gives these two ranking systems data not‭ ‬available from other sources.‭ ‬Many of the other reports compile their indexes from mainly published governmental statistics.‭ ‬Original data can also be created through the building of a formula that transforms available data‭; ‬if the formula has significant enough meaning in it and is reflective of a critical theory.‭   ‬The GaWC used sophisticated network analysis and social networking theory to do just this.‭</p>

<p><em>4.‭ ‬Having the report examined by an independent organization</em></p>

<p>The report issued by the Toronto Region Board of Trade stated that work was reviews by Chartered Professional Accountants.‭  ‬Using an independent body helps to counter any label of bias that may be attached to a report that is forthcoming from a group with vested interest in shaping legislation.‭</p> 

<p><em>5.‭ ‬Comparing‭ ‬a set of‭ ‬diverse cities from around the world</em></p>

<p>More than half of the index examined compared cities internationally.‭  ‬Including a diverse set of cities works well in some context such as the Rule of Law Index and the Global Financial Centres Index.‭  ‬Such a comparison works because the reader is left trying to understand the root underlying causes of the differences between cities.‭  ‬Why some cities are more inclined to be financial centres than others.‭  ‬However in the case of the Safe Cities Index and the Quality of Living Ranking,‭ ‬the action of comparing the cities moves from trying to understand if there are underlying social phenomenon to a more competitive reflexivity‭; ‬an unproductive‭ '‬is my city better‭' ‬stance.‭</p>

<p><em>6.‭  ‬Providing qualitative background to results</em></p>

Reports that added qualitative information to their rankings where more of interest.‭  ‬Providing a brief historical explanation of a city context helped to flush out and solidify any conclusions a report may have made.‭ 

<h3>Pitfalls to avoid.‭</h3>

<p><em>1.‭ ‬Comparing‭ ‬dissimilar cities</em></p>

<p>Sometimes cities are too dissimilar to compare.‭  ‬For example‭ ‬Visualizing Ontario’s Municipal Finance Data by the Institute on Municipal Finance‭ & ‬Governance‭ ‬compares property taxes between Toronto and some of its neighbouring municipalities.‭ ‬The analysis leaves out mention of the large structural difference between the jurisdictions.</p>

<p><em>2.‭ ‬Presentation is too complex</em></p>

<p>Some reports are too long,‭ ‬having pdf files approaching a hundred pages.‭  ‬This makes the report almost unreadable.‭  ‬Others rely too much on‭ ‬digital technology,‭ ‬the World Council on City Data only loads if Java is working properly.‭ ‬Other have graphs that are not easy to interpret because too much information is presented in them,‭ ‬such as‭  ‬The‭  ‬Safe Cities Index.‭</p> 

<p><em>3.‭ ‬Too‭ ‬'meta‭'‬ of a data analysis</em></p>

<p>Overly meta analysis can take three forms.‭ ‬The first being a fire-hose of information as‭ ‬the World Council on City Data approach takes.‭  ‬Almost every statistic is presented at once to a user.‭  ‬The‭ ‬second problem is having data that is too esoteric.‭ ‬The‭  ‬2016‭ ‬Open Cities Index‭ ‬asks very specific question about a city's open data,‭ ‬such as‭ '‬does the data have an API‭' ‬and is it available in bulk.‭  ‬This leaves the index with data cells that have no information,‭ ‬and the overall scores with little value.‭  ‬The third is the reuse of already gathered public information.‭  ‬Several indexes were repackaging‭ ‬already gathered statistics and adding little to no value.</p>

<p><em>4.‭ ‬No‭ ‬overall principle‭ ‬underlying the index</em></p>

<p>As it becomes easier to scrap data from various sources it becomes easier to compile and present the information back to a user.‭  ‬However the author of an index is an editor and as such their editorial decisions need to have some justification behind them.‭  ‬Not editing a stream of data is akin to not editing the minutes of a board meeting for a newspaper story‭; ‬it will be tediously long and not have its point come across.‭</p>

<p><em>5.‭ ‬Opaque methodology</em></p>

<p>Many of the studies mentioned do publish their methodologies and some‭ ‬do publish their‭ ‬raw data.‭  ‬However a few did not publish specifics of their methodology taking away the weight that their endeavour may have had.‭</p>

<h3>Evaluated Ranking Systems</h3>

1‭)‬Toronto's Vital Signs<br>
Toronto's Vital Signs Report‭ ‬2016‭<br>

<br>
</em>
<br>
About<br>
The Toronto Foundation is a pool of‭ ‬191‭ ‬community foundations‭ ‬administering‭ ‬$400‭ ‬million is‭ ‬assets.‭ 
The foundation engages in‭ '‬city building,‭ ‬mobilizing people and resources to increase the quality of life in Toronto‭'‬.‭  ‬The aim of the report is to‭ '‬inspire civic‭ ‬engagement and provide focus for public debate...‭'‬.‭ 
The Toronto's Vital Signs report is an annual report,‭ ‬265‭ ‬pages in length,‭ ‬and addresses ten issues such as economic health,‭ ‬health and wellness,‭ ‬safety,‭ ‬work,‭ ‬housing and transportation.‭<br>
<br> 
Methodology‭<br>
The report is‭ '‬compiled from current‭ ‬statistics and studies‭'‬.‭  ‬Each section is researched and the findings are drawn from governmental statistics and academic sources.‭  ‬The presentation is not as formal as an academic paper but it's final form is‭ ‬similar in style.‭<br>
<br>
Positive Attributes<br>
The report is seemingly well written and sourced.‭  ‬This may be due to many‭ ‬contributors helping to research each section.‭  ‬The final report produces a good snapshot of the city,‭ ‬and being an annual report,‭ ‬multi-year‭ ‬comparison can be done.
The introductory chapter‭ ‬explaining the‭ ‬demographics and census areas‭ ‬/‭ ‬municipal‭ ‬boundaries helps to ground the reader as to the size and‭ ‬complicity of the city of Toronto.‭ 
There are many simple graphs and short facts that can easily be used for press releases to gain publicity.‭<br>
<br>
Criticisms‭<br>
The report draws from other studies,‭ ‬and does not contribute original data.‭  
There are only ten areas of study.‭ ‬Each area that the report focused on,‭ ‬such as work or transportation,‭ ‬was a mini-paper within itself.‭  ‬There is no overall principle as to how to systematically study Toronto.‭

University of Toronto's Munk School's Institute on Municipal Finance and Governance partnered with the‭ ‬Institute without‭ ‬Boundaries at George Brown College to‭ ‬analyze the Ontario government's Financial Information Returns‭ (‬FIR‭)‬.‭<br>
<br>
Methodology‭<br>
A series of visualizations of Ontario's cities based around specific research questions,‭ ‬using the Ontario government's Financial Information Returns‭ (‬FIR‭) ‬that each municipality files.‭<br>
<br>
Positive Attributes<br>
This data visualization project tries to‭ ‬analyze very specific questions regarding municipal‭ ‬budgets,‭ ‬though only two are so far‭ ‬are‭ ‬explored on the website.‭<br>
<br>
Criticisms‭<br>
The project is still in development with only limited data.‭ ‬The graph design seems to designed for expounding a thesis rather than for an‭ ‬in-depth‭ ‬analysis,‭ ‬less an academic style more of a newspaper style.‭  ‬Little context as to the meanings and‭ ‬interpretations presented.‭<br>

About<br>
Describes itself as a‭ '‬global leader on standardized metrics‭'‬.‭  ‬The‭ ‬organization has members from around the world,‭ ‬and an ISO standard.‭<br>
<br>
Methodology<br>
The World Council on City Data seems to‭ ‬amalgamate statistics regarding different cities from governmental sources.‭  ‬Though,‭ ‬it is difficult to find where they are sourcing their information.‭  ‬Dozens of statistical facts are presented about each city,‭ ‬from total population,‭ ‬to percentage of women employed in the city government workforce.‭<br>
<br>
Positive Attributes<br>
The website is very‭ ‬dynamic,‭ ‬impressive‭ ‬visually‭ ‬with a good user interface.‭<br>
<br>
Criticisms<br>
It seems to just‭ '‬fire hose‭' ‬data and stats at you from a database that might be scrapping the‭ ‬Internet.‭ ‬Lots of factors/data but none of them‭ ‬properly explained as the what they are.‭  ‬Only works using‭ ‬Java.‭

About<br>
This index is the result of‭  ‬cooperation between several organization,‭ ‬including the Z/Yen Group‭ (‬a commercial think-tank in London,‭  ‬About Z/Yen,‭ ‬http://www.zyen.com/who-we-do.html‭)‬,‭ ‬the China Development Institute‭ (‬based in Shenzhe‭)‬,‭ ‬and the Financial Centre Futures‭ (‬Qatar Financial Centre Authority.‭ (‬The Global Financial Centres Index‭ ‬17,‭ ‬http://www.finance-montreal.com/sites/default/files/publications/gfci17‭_‬23march2015.pdf‭))‬.‭<br>
<br>
Methodology<br>
The ranking is based on a data from other ranking‭ ‬indexes such as the World Economic Readiness Index and the‭ ‬Telecommunication Infrastructure Index.‭ ‬An online questionnaire is also used.‭<br>
<br>
Positive‭ ‬Attributes‭<br>
It is a simple ranking to understand.‭  ‬Cities from other than N.‭ ‬America and Europe are represented on the index.‭ ‬An online questionnaire means that the index is built from data other than just other indexes.‭ ‬Because they have‭ ‬21‭ ‬of these reports a‭ ‬longitudinal‭ ‬comparison is done on how regions such as Asia/Pacific and Western Europe change in ranking over time.‭<br>
<br>
Criticisms<br>
The report is business centred,‭ ‬because it is trying to assess what are the main financial capitals of the world.‭

<br>
About<br>
This is a Toronto Region Board of Trade report that is sponsored by the Chartered Professional Accountants of Ontario with research support through The Conference Board of Canada.‭ ‬The purpose of the report is to‭ '‬measures‭  ‬and assesses the economy and labour attractiveness of the Toronto Census Metropolitan Area‭ (‬CMA‭) ‬against‭ ‬23‭ ‬other metropolitan areas around the globe‭'‬.<br>
<br>
Methodology<br>
Since‭ ‬2010‭ ‬the Scorecard on Prosperity has measured the same‭ (‬mostly economic‭) ‬indicators of‭ ‬24‭ ‬metropolitan areas.‭<br>
<br>
Positive Attributes<br>
The report looks at‭ ‬24‭ ‬metro areas.‭  ‬First a definition of the metro area is given.‭  ‬Because it was done over‭ ‬7‭ ‬years,‭ ‬a year to year comparison can be made.‭  ‬To keep the report interesting and relevant every year a special focus section is added,‭ ‬in‭ ‬2009‭ ‬the focus was on‭ ‬regional governance and‭ ‬2010‭ ‬it‭ ‬was‭ ‬access to capital.‭ ‬The‭ ‬study uses a report card-style ranking of A,B,C,D.‭  ‬There is also an effort of look at factors outside of business such as diversity and the‭ ‬environment.‭<br>
<br>
Criticisms‭<br>
The report is somewhat cumbersome to read at‭ ‬90‭ ‬pages.‭  ‬It is unclear in their methodology where the numbers came from,‭ ‬they were also unclear on how cities were weighed for differences.‭ ‬Did not attempt show what made cities structural different from one another‭ (‬comparing Toronto and Halifax seems odd‭)‬.The report tends to repeat statements,‭ ‬a typical statement from the report would be‭ “‬However,‭ ‬Toronto region’s initiatives must reach beyond‭  ‬North America.‭ ‬Ontario’s heavy reliance on the U.S.‭ ‬as a‭  ‬trade partner and the failure to expand to other fast-growing‭  ‬export markets and exploit them,‭ ‬particularly those located‭  ‬in Asia,‭ ‬helps explain why the‭ ‬2000s were largely a lost‭  ‬decade for provincial trade.‭” ‬It reads as a policy paper,‭ ‬with an aim to shape trade regulation in the Greater Toronto Area.‭<br>

<br>
Positive‭ ‬Attributes‭<br>
Each country gets its own scorecard to understand what is happening per country.‭  ‬Clear rankings and visuals.‭  ‬Only a‭ ‬handful of factors studied‭ ‬in depth‭ (‬such as labour costs,‭ ‬facility costs,‭ ‬transportation costs‭)‬,‭ ‬this keeps the report clearly focused.‭<br>

About<br>
The Public Sector Digest is a monthly digital and quarterly print publication written to advance the managerial capacity of Canada’s public sector.‭  ‬The report is written in‭ ‬partnership with Canada’s‭ ‬Open Data Exchange‭ (‬ODX‭)‬.‭ ‬ODX is a public-private-academic partnership based in Waterloo‭ ‬specializing in financial budgeting.‭ ‬The Open Cities Index measures cities‭’ ‬open data initiatives.‭<br>
<br>
Methodology‭<br>
Municipalities are scored‭ ‬ against the availability of‭ ‬32‭ ‬identified‭ ‬data-sets.‭ ‬These data-sets are checked to see if‭;<br>

7.‭ ‬Available in bulk<br>
9.‭ ‬Up to date<br>
10.‭ ‬Automated<br>
11.‭ ‬Linked to APIs<br>
<br>
Positive Attributes‭<br>
Uses‭ ‬11‭ ‬factors to assess a city,‭ ‬but gives each city one score.‭   ‬Limits cities to only Canada so results are comparable without too much differences between structure of cities.‭ ‬Quick to read and understand the information‭; ‬all the cities can be shown,‭ ‬compared on one graph.‭  ‬You can compare your city with other cities,‭ ‬plus to a national average,‭ ‬and‭ ‬ranks each city.‭<br>
<br>
Criticisms<br>
The reader losses a sense of what is in the open data set for each city,‭ ‬what type of data‭ ‬each city has,‭ ‬by limiting the examination to only‭ ‬38‭ ‬sets.‭  ‬The Index is only based on‭ ‬38‭ ‬data-sets per city,‭ ‬crucial‭ ‬data-sets,‭ ‬but only‭ ‬38‭ ‬of them.‭  ‬Are there critical data sets that are missing from a city‭?  ‬There is little of background about each cities open data initiative from a qualitative prescriptive,‭ ‬what is the story of a city's success/challenge to opening data‭?<br>

50‭ ‬cities are examined,‭ ‬with‭ ‬40‭ ‬quantitative and qualitative indicators‭ ‬studied.‭ ‬ Indicators are split‭ ‬into‭ ‬four categories:‭ ‬digital security‭; ‬health security‭; ‬infrastructure safety‭; ‬and personal safety.‭<br>
<br>
Positive Attributes.‭<br>
Though a simple ranking,‭ ‬using only a few variables,‭ ‬it can give‭ ‬surprisingly insightful results such as‭  “‬...wealth is not a byword for safety:‭ ‬every Middle Eastern city in the Index falls in the
highest income bracket,‭ ‬yet only one—Abu Dhabi makes it into the top half‭ ‬[of the index for being safe‭]‬.‭”<br>
<br>
Criticisms‭<br>
At times‭ ‬it just feels like a list of cities with little insight about how‭ ‬they are‭ ‬good or bad.‭ ‬The study uses personally safety for a proxy for economic development‭  ‬“[s]afety is closely linked to wealth and economic development‭”‬.
‭ ‬The multivariate comparison of means graph does not work,‭ ‬it looks like a spiderweb and is hard to decipher meaningful statistics from it.‭ 
The index‭ ‬compares mega-cities with populations of‭ ‬10‭ ‬million with cities that have a population of under a million.‭  
Some of the database is‭ ‬available through download,‭ ‬though you have to register.‭<br>
